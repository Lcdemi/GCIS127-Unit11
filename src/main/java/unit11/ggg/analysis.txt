1. The program goes a lot faster, since there is no longer a wait time between drops.
    When the sleep is reduced to 0, certain goats hog more turnips in a row when dropped because they have
    a faster priority to those turnips. This is because the one thread is already active, which gives it priority

2. One goat (usually cyan since its the first thread I start up) hogs all of the turnips because it has
    a greater priority since it was the first one active.
